#LAP 4 Group Project: Planet Pals
By Ursulan Malik, Emily Kral, Rhys Cairns, Guy Margalith and Bethan Vaughan

##Assignment Description
This is a group project that required a login and python backend. Other than that we were able to choose what application we produced. We settled on an application that would help improve the environment by creating competitions between friends, families and co-workers.

To run the code, create a python shell using the command pipenv shell, then download the required modules with pipenv install.
To run the server-side, type pipenv run manage.py
To run the client-side, cd into client folder and type npm install and then npm run dev

##Issues and Challenges
We experienced several small issues during the project. We had difficulty with the learning Django in such a short space of time along with the rest framework but adapted and use the documention well to overcome this. Another issue was keeping the user logged in throughout their entire session. We did this using redux-persist.

##Future Features

Sharing competitions across social media
Chat option to talk with your fellow competitiors
